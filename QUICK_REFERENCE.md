- Wait for 2-3 charts to align
- Example: Put wall + green bubbles + positive GEX = strong support

### 2. Strength Matters
- 80%+ strength = Respect the wall
- <30% strength = Wall may break
- Check GEX column for confirmation

### 3. Time of Day
- 9:30-10:30 AM = Volatile, walls break easily
- 10:30-3:00 PM = Range-bound, walls hold
- 3:00-4:00 PM = Power hour, momentum trades

### 4. Flip Level Psychology
- Above flip = Bulls in control
- Below flip = Bears in control
- Crossing flip = Momentum shift, wait for confirmation

### 5. Volume Confirmation
- High volume at wall = Likely to hold
- Low volume at wall = May break
- Check Volume Profile chart
